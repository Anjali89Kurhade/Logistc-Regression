Logistic regression is a statistical analysis method to predict a binary outcome, such as yes or no, based on prior observations of a data set
 There are lots of classification problems are available but logistics regression is a very common and useful regression method for solving a binary classification problem. 
 Another category of classification is Multinomial classification, which handles the problems where multiple classes are present in the target variable.
 Logistic Regression can be used for various classification problems such as spam detection, Diabetes prediction, if a given customer will purchase a particular product or will churn to another competitor, the user will click on a given advertisement link or not and many more examples are in the bucket.
Logistic Regression is one of the most simple and commonly used Machine Learning algorithms for two-class classification. It is easy to implement and can be used as the baseline for any binary classification problem.

Properties of Logistic Regression:
1) The dependent variable in logistic regression follows Bernoulli Distribution.
2) Estimation is done through maximum likelihood.
3) No R Square, Model fitness is calculated through Concordance, KS-Statistics.

Types of Logistic Regression:
1) Binary Logistic Regression: The target variable has only two possible outcomes such as Spam or Not Spam, Cancer, or No Cancer.
2) Multinomial Logistic Regression: The target variable has three or more nominal categories such as predicting the type of Wine.
3) Ordinal Logistic Regression: the target variable has three or more ordinal categories such as restaurant or product rating from 1 to 5.
